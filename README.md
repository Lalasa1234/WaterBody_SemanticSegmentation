## What is this about ⁉️
**Semantic segmentation of water bodies from satellite imagery**

This has a practical application in the space industry which researches extensively on planetary water bodies.

### What is the model architecture❔
Involves building the U-Net architecture (encoder-decoder) from the scratch

### Coding Blocks 👩‍💻👩‍💻
*EDA and testing geometric and color-space transformations*

*Defining the PyTorch Dataset and Dataloader functions along with specific transformations for image data and masked data*
